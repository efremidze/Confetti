## I want to contribute to _Confetti_

### Prerequisites

To develop _Confetti_, you will need to use an Xcode version compatible with the Swift version specified in the [README](https://github.com/efremidze/Confetti/#requirements).

### Checking out the repository

- Click the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button in the upper right corner of repo
- Clone your fork:
    - `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/Confetti.git`
- Create a new branch to work on:
    - `git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>`
    - A good name for a branch describes the thing you‚Äôll be working on, e.g. `voice-over`, `fix-font-size`, etc.

That‚Äôs it! Now you‚Äôre ready to work on _Confetti_. Open the `Confetti.xcworkspace` workspace to start coding.

### Things to keep in mind

- Please do not change the minimum iOS version
- Always document new public methods and properties

### Testing your local changes

Before opening a pull request, please make sure your changes don't break things.

- The framework and example project should build without warnings
- The example project should run without issues.

### Submitting the PR

When the coding is done and you‚Äôve finished testing your changes, you are ready to submit the PR to the [main repo](https://github.com/efremidze/Confetti). Some best practices are:

- Use a descriptive title
- Link the issues that are related to your PR in the body
